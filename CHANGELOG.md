# Changelog

## [2026-05-18]

### Added
- Speech-to-text via Web Speech API — click the mic button to dictate messages
- Voice commands: "kirim"/"send" to send, "stop"/"matikan mic" to stop, "hapus semua"/"clear all" to clear text
- Language toggle (ID/EN) for speech recognition
- Mic selection hint tooltip on voice button
- Browser setup guide for voice input, notifications, and PWA (EN+ID docs)
- Integration tests: auth, path traversal, unauthenticated access, offline agent handling

### Changed
- Voice input auto-stops on room switch and tab hide
- Voice input muted while AI is processing to prevent feedback loops
- Usage guides (EN+ID) synced with all current features

### Fixed
- Voice command multi-trigger — skip stale onresult events between stop and restart
- Search field autofill by password manager on page load
- Logout button styling in settings — solid button, consistent layout
- Frontend error handling: room rename, actor rename/delete, settings patch now check response.ok
- Removed redundant runtime ALTER TABLE migrations (avatar_url, attachments already in schema)
- Added missing database indexes (agent_skills.workdir_id, messages.participant_id, ai_sessions.participant_id)

## [2026-05-17]

### Added
- Multiple file/image upload per message (human and agent)
- Image carousel with drag/swipe navigation and fit-to-size display
- Client-side image compression (Canvas API, WebP 80%, max 1920px) before upload
- Server-side image compression via `tools/compress-image.js` (System.Drawing on Windows, ImageMagick/PIL on Linux)
- Reply quotes now show attached file URLs
- Agents receive all attachment URLs and download files locally for reading
- Automatic cleanup of agent temp files (`.stoa-attachments/`) between triggers
- Upload file cleanup cron (configurable via `CLEANUP_CRON_HOUR` and `CLEANUP_MAX_AGE_HOURS`)
- Copy button visual feedback (green checkmark on success)

### Changed
- Messages schema: added `attachments` JSON column for multi-file support
- Agent trigger payload now includes full `attachments` array with resolved URLs
- History context sent to agents includes attachment file names instead of unreachable URLs
- Carousel displays images at natural aspect ratio with horizontal free-scroll
- `stoa.js` iterates all attachments (images + text files) instead of only first file

### Fixed
- Copy button feedback not visible (root cause: `e.currentTarget` null after `await` in async arrow function)
- Old avatar files not deleted when uploading new avatar or deleting actor
